Softbody_lib is a sofbody library for S&box.
This project is still in early development.

Planned features:
1. 2D softbodies (flags, drapes, capes, 2D components)
2. Move spring logic to a compute shader
3. Control of shape retention
4. Definition control of which vertices should deform and which vertices should be locked to the mesh.
5. Other optimisation and stability changes.
